            <p>Great!  “Average GNP per Person” is one way to measure how much wealth there is in a country. Do you see any geographical patterns in this attribute?</p>

        <p>“Share of Income Owned by Top 1%” is a measure of how much of a country’s wealth is held by just 1% of the population. What do you notice about the graph?</p>

        <p>Now all you can see are the points you’ve selected. This action of looking at only a subset of the points is called “filtering." How do you think you could get the rest of the points back?</p>

  <p>Congratulations! You've done the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Created a map</li>
    <li>Dragged an attribute onto the map</li>
    <li>Moved the map</li>
    <li>Minimized the map</li>
    <li>Restored the map to its full size</li>
    <li>Selected attributes with higher values on a map</li>
    <li>Colored the map by a different attribute</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can do a <em>lot</em> with just those seven skills!</p>
