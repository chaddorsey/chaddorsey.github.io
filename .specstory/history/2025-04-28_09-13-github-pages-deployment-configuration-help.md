## GitHub Pages Deployment Configuration Help (4/28/2025, 9:13:33 AM)

_**User**_

I would like my repo to deploy to Github Pages when I push to the feature/attribute-selector-structure branch. Currently this isn't happening. Examine this file and help me configure it correctly. Here is a file that is deploying correctly for a different repository. My Github pages location is at chaddorsey.github.io.

name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["feature/expand-cube-size"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm install @chakra-ui/icons
        env:
          # Skip installing cypress since it isn't needed for just building
          CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY: 0
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build:webpack
        env:
          GITHUB_PAGES: 'true'
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

Let's start by clarifying the problem statement and requirements, as per our collaborative process:

---

### 1. Problem Statement

**Goal:**  
You want your repository to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when you push to the `feature/attribute-selector-structure` branch. Currently, this is not happening, and you want to ensure the workflow is configured correctly.

**Requirements:**
- The workflow should trigger on pushes to the `feature/attribute-selector-structure` branch.
- The deployment should use the correct build and deploy steps for a modern Node/React project (as in your working example).
- The deployment should target your GitHub Pages site at `chaddorsey.github.io`.
- The workflow should follow best practices for GitHub Actions and Pages deployment.

---

#### Please confirm or adjust the above problem statement and requirements.  
Once confirmed, I will draft a design document outlining the changes and improvements needed for your workflow.

_**User**_

This current codebase is a simple Javascript structure, so it does not need a Node/React project structure or deployment steps. Instead it should deploy with steps appropriate to the codebase. Examine the codebase as needed to determine this.

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for clarifying! Here’s an updated problem statement:

---

### 1. Problem Statement (Revised)

**Goal:**  
You want your repository to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when you push to the `feature/attribute-selector-structure` branch. The codebase is a simple JavaScript structure (not a Node/React app), so the deployment workflow should use the minimal steps necessary for a static site.

**Requirements:**
- The workflow should trigger on pushes to the `feature/attribute-selector-structure` branch.
- The deployment should use steps appropriate for a static JavaScript/HTML/CSS site (no build step required).
- The workflow should deploy the root of the branch to the `gh-pages` branch (or as required for GitHub Pages).
- The deployment should be reliable and follow best practices for static site deployment on GitHub Pages.

---

#### Please confirm or adjust the above problem statement and requirements.

Once confirmed, I will:
- Examine the codebase structure to verify what needs to be deployed.
- Draft a design document outlining the minimal and correct workflow for your use case.

Let me know if this captures your needs, or if you’d like to add or change anything!

This seems correct. Proceed.

_**Assistant**_

Great! Here’s the next step in our process:

## 2. Design Document

I’ll now draft a design document for the deployment workflow, tailored for a static JavaScript/HTML/CSS site.

### @context/design_doc.md

#### Title:  
**GitHub Actions Workflow for Deploying Static JavaScript Site to GitHub Pages on Branch Push**

#### Problem Statement  
We want to automatically deploy the contents of the `feature/attribute-selector-structure` branch to GitHub Pages whenever a push occurs on that branch. The codebase is a static site (HTML, CSS, JS), so no build step is required. The deployment should be minimal, reliable, and follow best practices for static site deployment.

#### Requirements
- Trigger deployment on push to `feature/attribute-selector-structure`.
- Deploy the root directory contents to the `gh-pages` branch.
- No build or dependency installation steps are needed.
- The workflow should be simple and maintainable.
- The deployed site should be accessible at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/`.

#### Proposed Solution

1. **Workflow Trigger:**  
   - Use the `push` event on the `feature/attribute-selector-structure` branch.

2. **Permissions:**  
   - Grant `contents: write` permission for pushing to `gh-pages`.

3. **Deployment Steps:**  
   - Checkout the branch.
   - Use a GitHub Action (e.g., `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4`) to deploy the root directory to the `gh-pages` branch.
   - No build or install steps are needed.

4. **Configuration Details:**  
   - The deploy action should copy the root directory (`.`) to the `gh-pages` branch.
   - The `target-folder` should be `/` (or omitted for root).
   - The workflow file should be named clearly (e.g., `deploy-branch.yml`).

5. **Optional:**  
   - Add a `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual deployments.

#### Example Workflow Outline

```yaml
name: Deploy branch to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feature/attribute-selector-structure
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: .
```

#### Open Questions
- Should the deployment overwrite the entire `gh-pages` branch, or only update a subfolder?
- Are there any files or folders that should be excluded from deployment (e.g., `.github/`, `README.md`)?

---

**Next Step:**  
Please review and confirm this design, or suggest any changes. Once approved, I’ll proceed to implementation planning and testing in a separate branch, following our TDD and phased approach.

The current file is a template file with incorrect details. my Github pages account is at chaddorsey.github.io. Suggest adjustments and ask questions to home in on the specific structure needed. Recall that the file structure above deploys a different repository correctly to my Github pages currently.

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for clarifying! Let’s focus on the specifics to ensure your workflow matches your needs and GitHub Pages’ requirements.

### Key Questions to Home In on the Structure

1. **Deployment Target:**  
   - Do you want the contents of the `feature/attribute-selector-structure` branch to be deployed to the root of `gh-pages` (so that `https://chaddorsey.github.io/` shows the site from this branch)?
   - Or do you want it deployed to a subfolder (e.g., `https://chaddorsey.github.io/feature-attribute-selector-structure/`)?

2. **Branch Structure:**  
   - Should this workflow overwrite the entire `gh-pages` branch with the contents of `feature/attribute-selector-structure`?
   - Or should it only update a subfolder within `gh-pages`?

3. **File Exclusions:**  
   - Are there any files or folders (like `.github/`, `README.md`, etc.) that should be excluded from deployment?

4. **Manual Deploys:**  
   - Do you want the ability to trigger deployments manually from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`), or only on push?

5. **Custom Domain or CNAME:**  
   - Are you using a custom domain (with a `CNAME` file), or just the default GitHub Pages URL?

---

### Suggested Adjustments (Based on Your Current Template)

- **Trigger:**  
  The trigger should be on `feature/attribute-selector-structure` (which you have).
- **Permissions:**  
  You only need `contents: write` for this action.
- **Deploy Action:**  
  The `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4` is appropriate for static sites.
- **Target Folder:**  
  If you want to deploy to the root, omit the `target-folder` parameter or set it to `/`.
- **Build Steps:**  
  No build or install steps are needed for a static site.

#### Example Minimal Workflow (for deploying root to `gh-pages`):

```yaml
name: Deploy branch to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feature/attribute-selector-structure
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: .
```

#### Please answer the questions above so I can finalize the workflow for your exact needs.  
Once you confirm, I’ll update the design and implementation plan accordingly!
