## Merge Current Branch into Main and Push (4/28/2025, 11:07:43 AM)

_**User**_

Help me fold the current branch into the main branch and push commits to the remote repo.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Before we proceed, let's follow our collaborative process:

### 1. Problem Statement

Let's clarify the problem statement together:

**Problem Statement:**  
You want to merge the changes from your current working branch into the `main` branch and push the updated `main` branch to the remote repository. This should ensure that all your latest work is integrated into the main codebase and available remotely.

#### Requirements:
- The current branch's changes should be safely integrated into `main`.
- Any merge conflicts should be resolved thoughtfully.
- The updated `main` branch should be pushed to the remote repository.
- The process should follow best practices (e.g., review, testing, clear commit history).

---

**Does this problem statement accurately capture your goal?**  
If you’d like to add or clarify anything, let’s discuss! Once you confirm, I’ll draft a design document outlining the steps and considerations for this merge.

---

_**User**_

Actually, I'd like to change that. I want the current branch to be available as a different tag so that the current deployment remains available at the original index.html. What are some ways I can achieve that?

---

_**Assistant**_

Thanks for clarifying! Let’s restate and refine the problem statement:

---

### 1. Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
You want to make the current branch’s version of your site available under a different tag or URL, so that the main deployment (served at the root `index.html` on GitHub Pages) remains unchanged. The goal is to allow users to access the current branch’s build at a separate, stable location (e.g., a subfolder or a custom tag), while the main site continues to serve the production version.

#### Requirements:
- The main deployment at the root (`index.html`) should not be affected.
- The current branch’s build should be accessible at a different, predictable URL (e.g., `/feature-branch/`, `/tag/v2/`, etc.).
- The solution should be maintainable and compatible with GitHub Pages.
- Ideally, the process should be repeatable for future branches or tags.

---

### 2. Discussion: Possible Approaches

Here are some common ways to achieve this with GitHub Pages:

#### **A. Deploy to a Subfolder on `gh-pages`**
- Use a GitHub Action (like `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`) to deploy the branch’s build to a subfolder (e.g., `/feature-branch/`) on the `gh-pages` branch.
- The main site remains at `/`, while the branch is available at `/feature-branch/`.

#### **B. Use GitHub Releases and Tags**
- Tag the branch and create a GitHub Release.
- Attach build artifacts to the release, but this does not provide a live preview URL—just downloadable files.

#### **C. Use Separate Branches for Previews**
- Deploy each branch to its own GitHub Pages site using a different branch (e.g., `gh-pages-feature-branch`), but this requires configuring GitHub Pages to serve from that branch, which is less flexible for multiple previews.

#### **D. Use a Custom Domain or Subdomain**
- If you control a custom domain, you can map subdomains to different branches or folders, but this is more advanced and requires DNS changes.

---

**Most common and maintainable:**  
**Option A** (deploying to a subfolder on `gh-pages`) is the most straightforward and aligns with your current workflow.

---

### Next Steps

1. **Confirm the approach:**  
   Do you want to proceed with deploying the current branch’s build to a subfolder (e.g., `/feature-branch/`) on the `gh-pages` branch, so it’s accessible at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/feature-branch/`?

2. **If yes:**  
   - We’ll update your GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the branch’s build to a subfolder.
   - The main site at `/` will remain unchanged.

---

**Does this approach sound good to you, or would you like to discuss other options?**  
Let me know your preference, and I’ll draft a design document for the chosen solution!

---

_**User**_

I have removed the .github/workflows folder and want to start fresh. Currently, my top-level folder is deployed to Gitub pages, so that the folder CountyHealthSelect, which contains a plugin project, is available at CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect. The Github pages for the repo chaddorsey/github.io is set up to deploy from the branch main and the root subfolder. I would like to retain this but deploy the feature branch to a separate URL. Describe how I can do this while retaining the current deployment at CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for the detailed context! Let’s clarify your requirements and discuss the best approach.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
You want to keep your current GitHub Pages deployment (from the `main` branch, root folder) unchanged, so that `CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect` remains available at its current URL. At the same time, you want to deploy the build from a feature branch to a separate, stable URL for preview/testing, without affecting the main deployment.

**Requirements:**
- The main deployment at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect` (from `main` branch, root) must remain unchanged.
- The feature branch should be deployed to a different URL (e.g., `https://chaddorsey.github.io/feature-preview/CountyHealthSelect` or similar).
- The process should be repeatable for future feature branches.
- No existing GitHub Actions workflows are present; you want a fresh setup.

---

## 2. Design Discussion: How to Achieve This

### A. How GitHub Pages Works in Your Setup

- **Current:**  
  - GitHub Pages is set to deploy from the `main` branch, root folder.
  - The folder `CountyHealthSelect` is available at `CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect`.

- **Goal:**  
  - Keep the above unchanged.
  - Deploy a feature branch’s build to a different subfolder (e.g., `/feature-preview/CountyHealthSelect`).

### B. Solution: Deploy Feature Branch to a Subfolder on `gh-pages`

#### **How it works:**
- Use a GitHub Action workflow that, when run on a feature branch, builds your project and deploys the output to a subfolder (e.g., `/feature-preview/`) on the `gh-pages` branch.
- The `main` branch continues to deploy from the root as before.
- The `gh-pages` branch will contain both the main site (at root) and the feature preview (at `/feature-preview/`).

#### **Resulting URLs:**
- Production: `https://chaddorsey.github.io/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect`
- Feature preview: `https://chaddorsey.github.io/feature-preview/CountyHealthSelect`

#### **Key Points:**
- The `gh-pages` branch will need to be managed so that the root is always the production build, and subfolders are used for previews.
- You can automate this with a GitHub Action that only deploys to a subfolder when on a feature branch.

---

## 3. Steps to Implement

1. **Set up a new GitHub Action workflow** that:
   - On push to a feature branch, builds the project and deploys to a subfolder on `gh-pages` (e.g., `/feature-preview/`).
   - On push to `main`, continues to deploy to the root of `gh-pages` (if you want to keep using `gh-pages` for production, or just leave `main` as the source for GitHub Pages as you do now).

2. **Configure the workflow** to:
   - Use a deploy action (e.g., `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` or `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`).
   - Specify the target directory for the deployment (root for production, subfolder for preview).

3. **Retain the current GitHub Pages settings:**
   - Keep GitHub Pages set to deploy from `main` branch, root folder for production.
   - Use the `gh-pages` branch only for previews, or as an artifact store.

---

## 4. Example Workflow Outline

- On push to feature branch:
  - Build project.
  - Deploy build output to `gh-pages/feature-preview/`.

- On push to `main`:
  - No change to current deployment (remains at root).

---

## 5. Next Steps

- **Confirm:** Is this approach (deploying feature branch builds to a subfolder on `gh-pages`) what you want?
- **If yes:** I’ll draft a design document and a sample GitHub Actions workflow for your review.

---

**Does this plan align with your goals?**  
Would you like to discuss any details or alternative approaches before we proceed to the design document?

---

_**User**_

Describe the design generically without reference to my specific repository.

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Here’s a generic design for maintaining a stable main deployment while allowing feature branch previews at separate URLs using GitHub Pages.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

**Goal:**  
Enable preview deployments for feature branches on GitHub Pages at unique URLs, while keeping the main deployment (from the default branch and root folder) unchanged and stable.

**Requirements:**
- The main site remains available at its original URL (e.g., `/project/`).
- Feature branch builds are accessible at separate, predictable URLs (e.g., `/feature-preview/project/`).
- The process is repeatable and maintainable for future branches.
- No existing deployment workflows are assumed.

---

## 2. Design Overview

### A. Main Deployment

- The main branch (often `main` or `master`) is configured as the source for GitHub Pages.
- The site is built and deployed from the root directory of the main branch.
- The main deployment is always available at the root URL (e.g., `https://username.github.io/project/`).

### B. Feature Branch Previews

- When a feature branch is updated, a workflow builds the project and deploys the output to a subfolder on a dedicated branch (commonly `gh-pages`).
- Each feature branch’s build is deployed to a unique subfolder (e.g., `/feature-branch-name/`).
- The preview is accessible at a URL like `https://username.github.io/feature-branch-name/project/`.

### C. Deployment Workflow

- A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to:
  - Trigger on pushes to feature branches.
  - Build the project.
  - Deploy the build output to a subfolder on the `gh-pages` branch (or another branch used for previews).
  - Optionally, clean up old previews as needed.

- The main branch workflow remains unchanged, continuing to deploy to the root.

---

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Set the main branch and root folder as the source for the main deployment.

2. **Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - On push to a feature branch:
     - Build the project.
     - Deploy the build output to a subfolder on the `gh-pages` branch named after the feature branch (e.g., `/feature-branch-name/`).
   - On push to the main branch:
     - (Optional) Deploy to the root of the `gh-pages` branch if you want to use `gh-pages` for production as well.

3. **Access URLs:**
   - Main deployment: `https://username.github.io/project/`
   - Feature preview: `https://username.github.io/feature-branch-name/project/`

---

## 4. Benefits

- The main site remains stable and unaffected by feature development.
- Stakeholders can preview feature branches at dedicated URLs.
- The process is automated and repeatable for any branch.

---

## 5. Considerations

- Ensure the build output supports being served from a subfolder (relative paths, etc.).
- Manage the `gh-pages` branch to avoid clutter from old previews.
- Optionally, automate cleanup of previews for deleted branches.

---

Would you like to see a sample workflow file or discuss any part of this design further?

---

_**User**_

Please show me a generic sample workflow file. Assume that the production deploys from the main branch and root folder and that pushes to any branch feature/foobar should deploy to a new URL at https://username.github.io/foobar/project/

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Here’s a generic GitHub Actions workflow that accomplishes this:

---

## Generic GitHub Actions Workflow for Feature Branch Previews

This workflow:
- Deploys the main branch (root) as usual (no action needed if GitHub Pages is set to deploy from `main`/root).
- On any push to a branch matching `feature/*`, builds the project and deploys it to a subfolder on the `gh-pages` branch named after the feature (e.g., `feature/foobar` → `/foobar/`).
- The preview is then available at:  
  `https://username.github.io/foobar/project/`

**Assumptions:**
- Your build output is in a folder like `dist` or `build`.
- You want to deploy the contents of that folder to the subfolder.

---

```yaml
# .github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
name: Deploy Feature Branch Preview

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'

jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18' # or your preferred version

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build # or your build command

      - name: Extract feature name
        id: extract
        run: echo "FEATURE_NAME=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/feature/}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Deploy to gh-pages subfolder
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist # or your build output directory
          destination_dir: ${{ env.FEATURE_NAME }}/project
          keep_files: true # keeps other previews and main site intact
          publish_branch: gh-pages
```

---

### How it works

- When you push to `feature/foobar`, the workflow:
  - Builds your project.
  - Deploys the build output to the `gh-pages` branch under `/foobar/project/`.
- The preview is available at:  
  `https://username.github.io/foobar/project/`
- The main site (from `main` branch, root) remains unchanged.

---

### Notes

- Make sure your project’s build supports being served from a subfolder (relative asset paths, etc.).
- The `keep_files: true` option ensures that other previews and the main site are not overwritten.
- You can clean up old previews manually or automate it with additional workflow steps if desired.

---

Would you like to discuss or customize this workflow further?

---

_**User**_

This is good. What would an example workflow file look like?

---

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! Here’s a concrete example of a workflow file that implements the generic design above. This example assumes:

- Your build output is in the `dist` directory.
- You want to deploy to a subfolder named after the feature branch (e.g., `feature/foobar` → `/foobar/project/`).
- You use Node.js and npm for building.
- You want to keep all other files in the `gh-pages` branch (so main and other previews are not overwritten).

---

```yaml
# .github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
name: Deploy Feature Branch Preview

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'

jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Extract feature name
        id: extract
        run: echo "FEATURE_NAME=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/feature/}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Deploy to gh-pages subfolder
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
          destination_dir: ${{ env.FEATURE_NAME }}/project
          keep_files: true
          publish_branch: gh-pages
```

---

### Example in Action

- If you push to a branch named `feature/foobar`, the workflow will deploy your build to:
  ```
  gh-pages/foobar/project/
  ```
  and it will be accessible at:
  ```
  https://username.github.io/foobar/project/
  ```

---

Let me know if you’d like to see a version for a different build system, output directory, or with additional features (like automatic cleanup of old previews)!

---

_**User**_

What file would I create in .github/workflows to do this?

---

_**Assistant**_

You would create a new YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.  
A common and descriptive name for this file would be:

```
.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
```

This file will contain the workflow configuration as shown in the previous example.  
You can name the file anything you like (e.g., `feature-preview.yml`, `deploy-preview.yml`, etc.), but it must have the `.yml` or `.yaml` extension and be placed inside the `.github/workflows` directory for GitHub Actions to recognize and run it.

Would you like a step-by-step guide for creating and committing this file, or do you have any other questions about the setup?

---

_**User**_

Create an example file at .github/feature-preview.yml. Assume my Github pages URL is chaddorsey.github.io.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Here’s an example workflow file you can place at `.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml` for your repository.  
This will deploy any branch named `feature/foobar` to `https://chaddorsey.github.io/foobar/project/` (assuming your build output is in the `dist` directory).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
name: Deploy Feature Branch Preview

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'

jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Extract feature name
        id: extract
        run: echo "FEATURE_NAME=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/feature/}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Deploy to gh-pages subfolder
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
          destination_dir: ${{ env.FEATURE_NAME }}/project
          keep_files: true
          publish_branch: gh-pages
```

**Instructions:**
1. Create the file at `.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml` in your repository.
2. Adjust the `publish_dir` if your build output is not in `dist`.
3. Push a branch named `feature/foobar` and the workflow will deploy to `https://chaddorsey.github.io/foobar/project/`.

_**User**_

I've had GitHub set to deploy to Pages from the main branch. What changes do I need to make on GitHub and how can I ensure that they will retain the deployment for the main branch index?

---

_**Assistant**_

Great question! Here’s a clear breakdown of what you need to do and what to check to ensure your main deployment remains stable while adding feature branch previews:

---

## 1. Current Setup

- **GitHub Pages is set to deploy from:**  
  `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder.
- **Your main site is available at:**  
  `https://chaddorsey.github.io/` (and subfolders, e.g., `/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect`).

---

## 2. What the Workflow Does

- The new workflow only deploys feature branches to the `gh-pages` branch, in subfolders.
- It does **not** touch the `main` branch or its deployment.
- Your GitHub Pages settings (deploying from `main`/root) remain unchanged.

---

## 3. What You Need to Do on GitHub

**A. Pages Settings:**
- **Do not change** your GitHub Pages settings.  
  Keep them set to deploy from the `main` branch and the root folder.

**B. Branch Protection:**
- If you have branch protection rules on `main`, they remain as is.

**C. gh-pages Branch:**
- The workflow will create/update the `gh-pages` branch for previews.
- This branch is not used for your main deployment, so it won’t affect your main site.

---

## 4. How to Ensure Main Deployment is Retained

- **Your main deployment will remain at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/` and its subfolders, served from the `main` branch.**
- The workflow for feature branches only affects the `gh-pages` branch and only for subfolders (e.g., `/foobar/project/`).
- As long as you do not change the GitHub Pages source setting, your main deployment is safe.

---

## 5. Optional: Test and Verify

1. **Push a change to `main`** and verify that your main site updates as expected.
2. **Push a feature branch** (e.g., `feature/foobar`) and verify that the preview appears at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/foobar/project/`.
3. **Check your GitHub Pages settings:**  
   - Go to your repo → Settings → Pages  
   - Ensure the source is still set to `main` branch, `/ (root)`.

---

## 6. Summary Table

| Branch         | GitHub Pages Source | URL                                 | Affected by Workflow? |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| main           | main / root        | https://chaddorsey.github.io/       | No                    |
| feature/foobar | (not used)         | https://chaddorsey.github.io/foobar/project/ | Yes (preview only)    |
| gh-pages       | (not used)         | (used for previews only)            | Yes (by workflow)     |

---

**In short:**  
You do not need to change your GitHub Pages settings.  
The workflow for feature branch previews is completely separate and will not interfere with your main deployment.

I've created a workflow file at `.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml` that is customized for your JavaScript project. Here's what I adjusted based on examining your project structure:

1. **No Build Step**: Your project doesn't appear to have a build process (based on the package.json), so I removed the npm build steps.

2. **Publish Directory**: Set to `./` to publish the whole repository content since there's no build output directory.

3. **Destination Directory**: Set to deploy to a subfolder named after the feature branch (e.g., `feature/new-layout` → `/new-layout/`).

4. **Project Structure**: The workflow preserves the existing directory structure, so the County Health Select plugin will be available at:
   - Main deployment (unchanged): `https://chaddorsey.github.io/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/`
   - Feature branch preview: `https://chaddorsey.github.io/[feature-name]/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/`

The workflow is now ready for use:

1. When you push to a branch named like `feature/new-feature`, it will:
   - Deploy that branch's content to the `gh-pages` branch in a subfolder named `new-feature`
   - Make it accessible at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/new-feature/`

Remember, your main deployment from the `main` branch (set in GitHub Pages settings) remains untouched.

Would you like to make any changes to this workflow?
