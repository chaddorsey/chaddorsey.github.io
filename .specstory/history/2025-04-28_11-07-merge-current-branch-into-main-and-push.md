## Merge Current Branch into Main and Push (4/28/2025, 11:07:43 AM)

_**User**_

Help me fold the current branch into the main branch and push commits to the remote repo.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Before we proceed, let's follow our collaborative process:

### 1. Problem Statement

Let's clarify the problem statement together:

**Problem Statement:**  
You want to merge the changes from your current working branch into the `main` branch and push the updated `main` branch to the remote repository. This should ensure that all your latest work is integrated into the main codebase and available remotely.

#### Requirements:
- The current branch's changes should be safely integrated into `main`.
- Any merge conflicts should be resolved thoughtfully.
- The updated `main` branch should be pushed to the remote repository.
- The process should follow best practices (e.g., review, testing, clear commit history).

---

**Does this problem statement accurately capture your goal?**  
If you’d like to add or clarify anything, let’s discuss! Once you confirm, I’ll draft a design document outlining the steps and considerations for this merge.

---

_**User**_

Actually, I'd like to change that. I want the current branch to be available as a different tag so that the current deployment remains available at the original index.html. What are some ways I can achieve that?

---

_**Assistant**_

Thanks for clarifying! Let’s restate and refine the problem statement:

---

### 1. Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
You want to make the current branch’s version of your site available under a different tag or URL, so that the main deployment (served at the root `index.html` on GitHub Pages) remains unchanged. The goal is to allow users to access the current branch’s build at a separate, stable location (e.g., a subfolder or a custom tag), while the main site continues to serve the production version.

#### Requirements:
- The main deployment at the root (`index.html`) should not be affected.
- The current branch’s build should be accessible at a different, predictable URL (e.g., `/feature-branch/`, `/tag/v2/`, etc.).
- The solution should be maintainable and compatible with GitHub Pages.
- Ideally, the process should be repeatable for future branches or tags.

---

### 2. Discussion: Possible Approaches

Here are some common ways to achieve this with GitHub Pages:

#### **A. Deploy to a Subfolder on `gh-pages`**
- Use a GitHub Action (like `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`) to deploy the branch’s build to a subfolder (e.g., `/feature-branch/`) on the `gh-pages` branch.
- The main site remains at `/`, while the branch is available at `/feature-branch/`.

#### **B. Use GitHub Releases and Tags**
- Tag the branch and create a GitHub Release.
- Attach build artifacts to the release, but this does not provide a live preview URL—just downloadable files.

#### **C. Use Separate Branches for Previews**
- Deploy each branch to its own GitHub Pages site using a different branch (e.g., `gh-pages-feature-branch`), but this requires configuring GitHub Pages to serve from that branch, which is less flexible for multiple previews.

#### **D. Use a Custom Domain or Subdomain**
- If you control a custom domain, you can map subdomains to different branches or folders, but this is more advanced and requires DNS changes.

---

**Most common and maintainable:**  
**Option A** (deploying to a subfolder on `gh-pages`) is the most straightforward and aligns with your current workflow.

---

### Next Steps

1. **Confirm the approach:**  
   Do you want to proceed with deploying the current branch’s build to a subfolder (e.g., `/feature-branch/`) on the `gh-pages` branch, so it’s accessible at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/feature-branch/`?

2. **If yes:**  
   - We’ll update your GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the branch’s build to a subfolder.
   - The main site at `/` will remain unchanged.

---

**Does this approach sound good to you, or would you like to discuss other options?**  
Let me know your preference, and I’ll draft a design document for the chosen solution!

---

_**User**_

I have removed the .github/workflows folder and want to start fresh. Currently, my top-level folder is deployed to Gitub pages, so that the folder CountyHealthSelect, which contains a plugin project, is available at CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect. The Github pages for the repo chaddorsey/github.io is set up to deploy from the branch main and the root subfolder. I would like to retain this but deploy the feature branch to a separate URL. Describe how I can do this while retaining the current deployment at CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for the detailed context! Let’s clarify your requirements and discuss the best approach.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
You want to keep your current GitHub Pages deployment (from the `main` branch, root folder) unchanged, so that `CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect` remains available at its current URL. At the same time, you want to deploy the build from a feature branch to a separate, stable URL for preview/testing, without affecting the main deployment.

**Requirements:**
- The main deployment at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect` (from `main` branch, root) must remain unchanged.
- The feature branch should be deployed to a different URL (e.g., `https://chaddorsey.github.io/feature-preview/CountyHealthSelect` or similar).
- The process should be repeatable for future feature branches.
- No existing GitHub Actions workflows are present; you want a fresh setup.

---

## 2. Design Discussion: How to Achieve This

### A. How GitHub Pages Works in Your Setup

- **Current:**  
  - GitHub Pages is set to deploy from the `main` branch, root folder.
  - The folder `CountyHealthSelect` is available at `CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect`.

- **Goal:**  
  - Keep the above unchanged.
  - Deploy a feature branch’s build to a different subfolder (e.g., `/feature-preview/CountyHealthSelect`).

### B. Solution: Deploy Feature Branch to a Subfolder on `gh-pages`

#### **How it works:**
- Use a GitHub Action workflow that, when run on a feature branch, builds your project and deploys the output to a subfolder (e.g., `/feature-preview/`) on the `gh-pages` branch.
- The `main` branch continues to deploy from the root as before.
- The `gh-pages` branch will contain both the main site (at root) and the feature preview (at `/feature-preview/`).

#### **Resulting URLs:**
- Production: `https://chaddorsey.github.io/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect`
- Feature preview: `https://chaddorsey.github.io/feature-preview/CountyHealthSelect`

#### **Key Points:**
- The `gh-pages` branch will need to be managed so that the root is always the production build, and subfolders are used for previews.
- You can automate this with a GitHub Action that only deploys to a subfolder when on a feature branch.

---

## 3. Steps to Implement

1. **Set up a new GitHub Action workflow** that:
   - On push to a feature branch, builds the project and deploys to a subfolder on `gh-pages` (e.g., `/feature-preview/`).
   - On push to `main`, continues to deploy to the root of `gh-pages` (if you want to keep using `gh-pages` for production, or just leave `main` as the source for GitHub Pages as you do now).

2. **Configure the workflow** to:
   - Use a deploy action (e.g., `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` or `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`).
   - Specify the target directory for the deployment (root for production, subfolder for preview).

3. **Retain the current GitHub Pages settings:**
   - Keep GitHub Pages set to deploy from `main` branch, root folder for production.
   - Use the `gh-pages` branch only for previews, or as an artifact store.

---

## 4. Example Workflow Outline

- On push to feature branch:
  - Build project.
  - Deploy build output to `gh-pages/feature-preview/`.

- On push to `main`:
  - No change to current deployment (remains at root).

---

## 5. Next Steps

- **Confirm:** Is this approach (deploying feature branch builds to a subfolder on `gh-pages`) what you want?
- **If yes:** I’ll draft a design document and a sample GitHub Actions workflow for your review.

---

**Does this plan align with your goals?**  
Would you like to discuss any details or alternative approaches before we proceed to the design document?

---

_**User**_

Describe the design generically without reference to my specific repository.

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Here’s a generic design for maintaining a stable main deployment while allowing feature branch previews at separate URLs using GitHub Pages.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

**Goal:**  
Enable preview deployments for feature branches on GitHub Pages at unique URLs, while keeping the main deployment (from the default branch and root folder) unchanged and stable.

**Requirements:**
- The main site remains available at its original URL (e.g., `/project/`).
- Feature branch builds are accessible at separate, predictable URLs (e.g., `/feature-preview/project/`).
- The process is repeatable and maintainable for future branches.
- No existing deployment workflows are assumed.

---

## 2. Design Overview

### A. Main Deployment

- The main branch (often `main` or `master`) is configured as the source for GitHub Pages.
- The site is built and deployed from the root directory of the main branch.
- The main deployment is always available at the root URL (e.g., `https://username.github.io/project/`).

### B. Feature Branch Previews

- When a feature branch is updated, a workflow builds the project and deploys the output to a subfolder on a dedicated branch (commonly `gh-pages`).
- Each feature branch’s build is deployed to a unique subfolder (e.g., `/feature-branch-name/`).
- The preview is accessible at a URL like `https://username.github.io/feature-branch-name/project/`.

### C. Deployment Workflow

- A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to:
  - Trigger on pushes to feature branches.
  - Build the project.
  - Deploy the build output to a subfolder on the `gh-pages` branch (or another branch used for previews).
  - Optionally, clean up old previews as needed.

- The main branch workflow remains unchanged, continuing to deploy to the root.

---

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Set the main branch and root folder as the source for the main deployment.

2. **Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - On push to a feature branch:
     - Build the project.
     - Deploy the build output to a subfolder on the `gh-pages` branch named after the feature branch (e.g., `/feature-branch-name/`).
   - On push to the main branch:
     - (Optional) Deploy to the root of the `gh-pages` branch if you want to use `gh-pages` for production as well.

3. **Access URLs:**
   - Main deployment: `https://username.github.io/project/`
   - Feature preview: `https://username.github.io/feature-branch-name/project/`

---

## 4. Benefits

- The main site remains stable and unaffected by feature development.
- Stakeholders can preview feature branches at dedicated URLs.
- The process is automated and repeatable for any branch.

---

## 5. Considerations

- Ensure the build output supports being served from a subfolder (relative paths, etc.).
- Manage the `gh-pages` branch to avoid clutter from old previews.
- Optionally, automate cleanup of previews for deleted branches.

---

Would you like to see a sample workflow file or discuss any part of this design further?

---

_**User**_

Please show me a generic sample workflow file. Assume that the production deploys from the main branch and root folder and that pushes to any branch feature/foobar should deploy to a new URL at https://username.github.io/foobar/project/

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Here’s a generic GitHub Actions workflow that accomplishes this:

---

## Generic GitHub Actions Workflow for Feature Branch Previews

This workflow:
- Deploys the main branch (root) as usual (no action needed if GitHub Pages is set to deploy from `main`/root).
- On any push to a branch matching `feature/*`, builds the project and deploys it to a subfolder on the `gh-pages` branch named after the feature (e.g., `feature/foobar` → `/foobar/`).
- The preview is then available at:  
  `https://username.github.io/foobar/project/`

**Assumptions:**
- Your build output is in a folder like `dist` or `build`.
- You want to deploy the contents of that folder to the subfolder.

---

```yaml
# .github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
name: Deploy Feature Branch Preview

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'

jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18' # or your preferred version

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build # or your build command

      - name: Extract feature name
        id: extract
        run: echo "FEATURE_NAME=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/feature/}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Deploy to gh-pages subfolder
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist # or your build output directory
          destination_dir: ${{ env.FEATURE_NAME }}/project
          keep_files: true # keeps other previews and main site intact
          publish_branch: gh-pages
```

---

### How it works

- When you push to `feature/foobar`, the workflow:
  - Builds your project.
  - Deploys the build output to the `gh-pages` branch under `/foobar/project/`.
- The preview is available at:  
  `https://username.github.io/foobar/project/`
- The main site (from `main` branch, root) remains unchanged.

---

### Notes

- Make sure your project’s build supports being served from a subfolder (relative asset paths, etc.).
- The `keep_files: true` option ensures that other previews and the main site are not overwritten.
- You can clean up old previews manually or automate it with additional workflow steps if desired.

---

Would you like to discuss or customize this workflow further?

---

_**User**_

This is good. What would an example workflow file look like?

---

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! Here’s a concrete example of a workflow file that implements the generic design above. This example assumes:

- Your build output is in the `dist` directory.
- You want to deploy to a subfolder named after the feature branch (e.g., `feature/foobar` → `/foobar/project/`).
- You use Node.js and npm for building.
- You want to keep all other files in the `gh-pages` branch (so main and other previews are not overwritten).

---

```yaml
# .github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
name: Deploy Feature Branch Preview

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'

jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Extract feature name
        id: extract
        run: echo "FEATURE_NAME=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/feature/}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Deploy to gh-pages subfolder
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
          destination_dir: ${{ env.FEATURE_NAME }}/project
          keep_files: true
          publish_branch: gh-pages
```

---

### Example in Action

- If you push to a branch named `feature/foobar`, the workflow will deploy your build to:
  ```
  gh-pages/foobar/project/
  ```
  and it will be accessible at:
  ```
  https://username.github.io/foobar/project/
  ```

---

Let me know if you’d like to see a version for a different build system, output directory, or with additional features (like automatic cleanup of old previews)!

---

_**User**_

What file would I create in .github/workflows to do this?

---

_**Assistant**_

You would create a new YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.  
A common and descriptive name for this file would be:

```
.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
```

This file will contain the workflow configuration as shown in the previous example.  
You can name the file anything you like (e.g., `feature-preview.yml`, `deploy-preview.yml`, etc.), but it must have the `.yml` or `.yaml` extension and be placed inside the `.github/workflows` directory for GitHub Actions to recognize and run it.

Would you like a step-by-step guide for creating and committing this file, or do you have any other questions about the setup?

---

_**User**_

Create an example file at .github/feature-preview.yml. Assume my Github pages URL is chaddorsey.github.io.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Here’s an example workflow file you can place at `.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml` for your repository.  
This will deploy any branch named `feature/foobar` to `https://chaddorsey.github.io/foobar/project/` (assuming your build output is in the `dist` directory).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
name: Deploy Feature Branch Preview

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'

jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Extract feature name
        id: extract
        run: echo "FEATURE_NAME=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/feature/}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Deploy to gh-pages subfolder
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
          destination_dir: ${{ env.FEATURE_NAME }}/project
          keep_files: true
          publish_branch: gh-pages
```

**Instructions:**
1. Create the file at `.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml` in your repository.
2. Adjust the `publish_dir` if your build output is not in `dist`.
3. Push a branch named `feature/foobar` and the workflow will deploy to `https://chaddorsey.github.io/foobar/project/`.

_**User**_

I've had GitHub set to deploy to Pages from the main branch. What changes do I need to make on GitHub and how can I ensure that they will retain the deployment for the main branch index?

---

_**Assistant**_

Great question! Here’s a clear breakdown of what you need to do and what to check to ensure your main deployment remains stable while adding feature branch previews:

---

## 1. Current Setup

- **GitHub Pages is set to deploy from:**  
  `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder.
- **Your main site is available at:**  
  `https://chaddorsey.github.io/` (and subfolders, e.g., `/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect`).

---

## 2. What the Workflow Does

- The new workflow only deploys feature branches to the `gh-pages` branch, in subfolders.
- It does **not** touch the `main` branch or its deployment.
- Your GitHub Pages settings (deploying from `main`/root) remain unchanged.

---

## 3. What You Need to Do on GitHub

**A. Pages Settings:**
- **Do not change** your GitHub Pages settings.  
  Keep them set to deploy from the `main` branch and the root folder.

**B. Branch Protection:**
- If you have branch protection rules on `main`, they remain as is.

**C. gh-pages Branch:**
- The workflow will create/update the `gh-pages` branch for previews.
- This branch is not used for your main deployment, so it won’t affect your main site.

---

## 4. How to Ensure Main Deployment is Retained

- **Your main deployment will remain at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/` and its subfolders, served from the `main` branch.**
- The workflow for feature branches only affects the `gh-pages` branch and only for subfolders (e.g., `/foobar/project/`).
- As long as you do not change the GitHub Pages source setting, your main deployment is safe.

---

## 5. Optional: Test and Verify

1. **Push a change to `main`** and verify that your main site updates as expected.
2. **Push a feature branch** (e.g., `feature/foobar`) and verify that the preview appears at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/foobar/project/`.
3. **Check your GitHub Pages settings:**  
   - Go to your repo → Settings → Pages  
   - Ensure the source is still set to `main` branch, `/ (root)`.

---

## 6. Summary Table

| Branch         | GitHub Pages Source | URL                                 | Affected by Workflow? |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| main           | main / root        | https://chaddorsey.github.io/       | No                    |
| feature/foobar | (not used)         | https://chaddorsey.github.io/foobar/project/ | Yes (preview only)    |
| gh-pages       | (not used)         | (used for previews only)            | Yes (by workflow)     |

---

**In short:**  
You do not need to change your GitHub Pages settings.  
The workflow for feature branch previews is completely separate and will not interfere with your main deployment.

I've created a workflow file at `.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml` that is customized for your JavaScript project. Here's what I adjusted based on examining your project structure:

1. **No Build Step**: Your project doesn't appear to have a build process (based on the package.json), so I removed the npm build steps.

2. **Publish Directory**: Set to `./` to publish the whole repository content since there's no build output directory.

3. **Destination Directory**: Set to deploy to a subfolder named after the feature branch (e.g., `feature/new-layout` → `/new-layout/`).

4. **Project Structure**: The workflow preserves the existing directory structure, so the County Health Select plugin will be available at:
   - Main deployment (unchanged): `https://chaddorsey.github.io/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/`
   - Feature branch preview: `https://chaddorsey.github.io/[feature-name]/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/`

The workflow is now ready for use:

1. When you push to a branch named like `feature/new-feature`, it will:
   - Deploy that branch's content to the `gh-pages` branch in a subfolder named `new-feature`
   - Make it accessible at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/new-feature/`

Remember, your main deployment from the `main` branch (set in GitHub Pages settings) remains untouched.

Would you like to make any changes to this workflow?

What should I do with these errors? 

---

_**Assistant**_

You're encountering a GitHub file size limit error. GitHub has a maximum file size limit of 100MB per file, but your repository contains a file that's 183.67MB:

```
File CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/assets/data/CountyHealth-All-Data.zip is 183.67 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
```

Here are your options to resolve this issue:

### Option 1: Use Git Large File Storage (LFS)

GitHub recommends using Git LFS for large files. This is the best approach if you need to keep this large file in your repository:

1. **Install Git LFS**:
   ```bash
   brew install git-lfs  # On macOS with Homebrew
   ```

2. **Set up Git LFS in your repository**:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

3. **Track the large file**:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/assets/data/CountyHealth-All-Data.zip"
   ```

4. **Add the .gitattributes file that was created**:
   ```bash
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

5. **Re-add the large file and commit**:
   ```bash
   git add CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/assets/data/CountyHealth-All-Data.zip
   git commit -m "Add large file using Git LFS"
   ```

6. **Push again**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/attribute-selector-structure
   ```

### Option 2: Remove the large file from your repository

If the data file doesn't need to be in the repository:

1. **Remove the file from your commit**:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/assets/data/CountyHealth-All-Data.zip
   git commit -m "Remove large data file"
   ```

2. **Add the file to .gitignore**:
   ```bash
   echo "CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/assets/data/CountyHealth-All-Data.zip" >> .gitignore
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add large data file to gitignore"
   ```

3. **Push again**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/attribute-selector-structure
   ```

### Option 3: Host the data file externally

You could host the data file on an external service and reference it in your code:

1. Host on cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
2. Update your code to point to the external URL
3. Remove the file from your repository using the steps in Option 2

### Which option is best?

If this is a data file your application needs:
- Option 1 (Git LFS) is best if you need version control for the file
- Option 3 (External hosting) is best if the file rarely changes and doesn't need versioning

Would you like me to help you implement one of these solutions?

I'm still getting this:

_**Assistant**_

I see that you've already tried ignoring the large file using `.gitignore`, but you're still getting the error. This happens because Git is still tracking the file even though you've added it to `.gitignore`.

The `.gitignore` file only prevents untracked files from being added to the repository. If the file was already tracked before you added it to `.gitignore`, Git will continue to track it.

Here's how to completely remove the large file from your repository:

1. **Remove the file from Git's tracking but keep it on your disk**:

```bash
git rm --cached CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/assets/data/CountyHealth-All-Data.zip
```

2. **Commit this change**:

```bash
git commit -m "Remove large data file from Git tracking"
```

3. **Force push to overwrite the remote branch history**:

```bash
git push -f origin feature/attribute-selector-structure
```

If you're getting this error when trying to merge or push to another branch, you'll need to ensure the large file is completely removed from your Git history. This can be more complex and might require rewriting Git history using `git filter-branch` or the BFG Repo-Cleaner.

Would you like me to provide instructions for completely removing the file from your Git history?

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. You've added the file to `.gitignore`, but it's still in your Git history. Since you've already committed the large file in the past, simply adding it to `.gitignore` isn't enough to remove it from Git's tracking.

You need to remove the file from your Git history completely:

1. **First, remove the file from Git tracking but keep it on disk**:

```bash
git rm --cached CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/assets/data/CountyHealth-All-Data.zip
git commit -m "Remove large data file from tracking"
```

2. **Then, rewrite Git history to remove the file from past commits** using the BFG Repo-Cleaner (easier than `git filter-branch`):

```bash
# Download BFG Repo-Cleaner
curl -o bfg.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar

# Create a backup of your repo
cp -r .git .git.bak

# Remove the large file from history
java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files CountyHealth-All-Data.zip .

# Clean up and optimize the repository
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push to update the remote branch
git push -f origin feature/attribute-selector-structure
```

This approach will completely remove the large file from your Git history, which is necessary to successfully push to GitHub.

Alternatively, if you're more comfortable with a simpler approach and don't mind creating a fresh branch:

1. **Create a new branch from main/master (without the large file)**:
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/attribute-selector-structure-new
```

2. **Copy your changes (excluding the large file) to the new branch**
3. **Add the large file to .gitignore before committing**
4. **Commit and push the new branch**

Would you like more detailed instructions for either approach?

_**User**_

Where should my feature be now?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on our discussion and the steps you've taken, here's where your feature should be:

1. **Main Branch**: Unchanged. Your main deployment at `https://chaddorsey.github.io/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/` should still be working as before.

2. **Feature Branch**: You've been working in a branch (which appears to be `feature/attribute-selector-structure` based on previous context).

3. **Deployment Status**: The GitHub workflow we created (`.github/workflows/feature-preview.yml`) should trigger whenever you push to a branch starting with `feature/`.

If you've successfully pushed your feature branch (after resolving the large file issue), your feature should be deployed to:

```
https://chaddorsey.github.io/attribute-selector-structure/CODAP-plugins/CountyHealthSelect/
```

(The prefix "feature/" is removed from the URL, leaving just the branch name "attribute-selector-structure")

You can check the deployment status in your GitHub repository by:

1. Going to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Looking for the most recent run of the "Deploy Feature Branch Preview" workflow
3. Checking if it completed successfully

If the workflow ran successfully, your feature branch should be accessible at the URL mentioned above. If not, you might need to check the workflow logs for any errors.

Would you like help troubleshooting the deployment or checking its status?

I see "Annotations

Action failed with "The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128"

---

_**Assistant**_

This error typically occurs in GitHub Actions when there's a Git-related issue. Let's troubleshoot the workflow failure:

### Common Causes and Solutions for "Git failed with exit code 128"

1. **Permission Issues**

The GitHub token may not have sufficient permissions to deploy to the gh-pages branch.

**Solution**:
- Check that your workflow is using the correct token: `github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
- You might need to adjust repository settings to allow GitHub Actions to create and push to branches

2. **Large Files Issue**

The large file might still be causing problems in the workflow.

**Solution**:
- Make sure the large file is completely removed from all branches that the workflow is processing
- Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes the large file

3. **Git Configuration Issues**

Sometimes the workflow fails because Git isn't properly configured.

**Solution**:
- Add explicit Git configuration steps to your workflow

Let's modify your workflow file to include more debugging information and better error handling:

+           force_orphan: false 
```

I've updated your workflow file with several improvements to help diagnose and fix the "git failed with exit code 128" error:

### Key Changes:

1. **Added Git Configuration**:
   - Explicitly sets Git user name and email, which can prevent authentication issues.

2. **Added Debug Information**:
   - Outputs useful information about the repository, branch, and workspace.
   - Lists all files and directory sizes to help identify large files.

3. **Added Large File Removal Step**:
   - Automatically finds and removes files larger than 50MB.
   - Focuses on ZIP files (like your problematic CountyHealth-All-Data.zip).

4. **Modified Deployment Options**:
   - Added `force_orphan: false` to preserve history when possible.

### Next Steps:

1. **Commit these changes** to your feature branch:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/feature-preview.yml
git commit -m "Update workflow with better error handling"
git push origin feature/attribute-selector-structure
```

2. **Check GitHub Actions** after the push to see if the error persists.

3. **Review the logs** carefully, especially the output from the "Debug Info" step, which will show:
   - What large files are present
   - The structure of your repository
   - Other details that might help identify the issue

If the error still persists, we may need to try a different approach, such as:

1. Creating a `.gitattributes` file to handle large files with Git LFS
2. Creating a separate workflow branch that excludes the large files
3. Using a different deployment strategy, such as a custom script

Would you like me to explain any of these alternative approaches in more detail?

_**Assistant**_

This error indicates a permissions issue. GitHub Actions doesn't have permission to push to your repository. This happens because GitHub Pages repositories have special security settings.

### Solution: Update Repository Permissions

For GitHub Pages repositories, you need to explicitly give GitHub Actions permission to write to your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings**
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Actions** under "Code and automation"
4. Under "Workflow permissions", select **Read and write permissions**
5. Click **Save**

This will allow GitHub Actions to push to your repository.

Alternatively, you can create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with push permissions and use that instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Click on **Developer settings** in the left sidebar
3. Click on **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
4. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
5. Name it something like "GitHub Pages Deployment"
6. Select the **repo** scope (full control of repositories)
7. Click **Generate token** and copy the token

Then, add this token as a repository secret:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings**
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Name it `PAT` and paste your token as the value
6. Click **Add secret**

Then update your workflow file to use this token:
